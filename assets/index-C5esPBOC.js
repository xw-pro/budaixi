In recent times, Southern Fujian Puppet Theatre is most representative of Zhangzhou. Zhangzhou Puppetry is a comprehensive traditional folk art which consists of puppet performance theatre, puppetry, puppet head carving and other combinations. Zhangzhou bag puppet theatre has a long history, which "originated in Jin, shaped in the Tang and Song dynasties, and flourished in the Ming Dynasty". As early as in the Ming Dynasty during the Wanli period, it spread to Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan and other places. In the course of its development, a number of different schools were formed, mainly the "Fuchun", "Fuxing" and "Peony Pavilion" schools, each with its own characteristics. Puppetry performances are delicate and lifelike. Puppet manipulation with five fingers can not only reflect the singing, reading, acting and playing of human theatre, as well as the feelings of joy, anger, sadness and happiness, but also perform some actions that are difficult to be reflected in human theatre, making it a kind of puppetry theatre with superb skills, exquisite modelling and unique styles.

Puppetry has a long history, and is said to have begun in the Ming Dynasty, circulating in Fujian Minnan, Taiwan and Southeast Asia where overseas Chinese reside. In the 1920s and 1930s, Xiamen used to be the main place for the performance of Minnan Bubu Puppet Theatre. The puppet theatre uses gloves on the puppets, with the palm of the hand as the torso of the puppeteer, the index finger to support the head, the thumb and the other three fingers to support the left and right arms, respectively, to manipulate the puppets for theatre performances, which not only can reflect the human theatre of singing, reciting, doing, playing kung fu, but also can express the feelings of joy, anger, sadness and happiness. ",-1)),k={class:"traditional-item"},F=n(()=>e("div",{class:"title"},"Taiwan Puppet Theatre",-1)),L=n(()=>e("div",{class:"text"},` The traditional Taiwanese puppet theatre is said to have been introduced from the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong in the 18th year of the Shunzhi reign in the Qing Dynasty (1661). Initially, it was popular in Chiayi, Lugang, and other areas in Taiwan inhabited by southern Min people, and the songs and tunes were all in southern Min dialect, so it was known as the hometown theatre by southern Min people. Later, it gradually spread to the whole province of Taiwan. The Japanese imperialists invaded Taiwan and tried their best to implement the policy of "imperialisation", forcing the Taiwanese puppet theatre to be changed into Japanese puppet theatre, with Taiwanese mixed with Japanese, accompanied by Western instruments, which was mercilessly trampled on, and some of the old performers were transferred to the countryside and the people. In the 1950s, there were more than 500 registered puppet theatre groups, but due to the impact of the so-called modern art, there were only a few left. Only a few troupes, such as Hsu Wang's Xiao Xiyuan and Li Tianlu's Yiyuanran in Taipei, still retain the remnants of Zhangquan Puppet Theatre. `,-1)),B={__name:"item",setup(t){return(g,_)=>{const i=h("el-image"),s=h("el-button");return l(),c("div",T,[e("div",x,[a(i,{class:"img",src:o(w),fit:"fill"},null,8,["src"]),P,a(s,{style:{width:"120px"},type:"danger"},{default:r(()=>[p(" Learn more ")]),_:1}),I]),e("div",S,[a(i,{class:"img",src:o(v),fit:"fill"},null,8,["src"]),j,a(s,{style:{width:"120px"},type:"danger"},{default:r(()=>[p(" Learn more ")]),_:1}),M]),e("div",k,[a(i,{class:"img",src:o(b),fit:"fill"},null,8,["src"]),F,a(s,{style:{width:"120px"},type:"danger"},{default:r(()=>[p(" Learn more ")]),_:1}),L])])}}},D=d(B,[["__scopeId","data-v-c78db4ef"]]),m=t=>(u("data-v-bf836d3f"),t=t(),f(),t),Z={class:"traditional-page"},$=m(()=>e("div",{class:"header"},"Traditional Puppet Show",-1)),z=m(()=>e("div",{class:"bg"},null,-1)),C={class:"content"},J={__name:"index",setup(t){return(g,_)=>(l(),c("div",Z,[$,z,e("div",C,[a(D)]),a(y)]))}},N=d(J,[["__scopeId","data-v-bf836d3f"]]);export{N as default};
