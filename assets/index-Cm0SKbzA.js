It is one of the traditional local theatre of the Southern Fujian language . The head of the puppet is carved from wood into a hollow human head, in addition to the puppet head, puppet palms and puppet feet, the body of the puppet body of the body of the puppet and the limbs of the puppet are made of fabric clothing; performance, the glove into the puppet&#39;s costume for the puppet manipulation performance. It is precisely because the body of the puppets in this type of performance in the early days was very much like a &quot;bag made of fabric&quot; that the common name of Bu Bu Dai Theatre came into being. </div><div class="text" style="display:flex;" data-v-4efd4186><div style="border-left:1px solid #ddd;height:30px;width:20px;" data-v-4efd4186></div> “征衣红尘化云烟，江湖落拓不知年， 剑痴刀狂世纷云，今将衣钵卸双肩； 踏尽千山无人识，当初枉受盛名牵， 东风吹醒英雄梦，笑对青山万重天。” 《霹雳布袋戏》 </div><div class="intro" data-v-4efd4186><div class="tradit" data-v-4efd4186></div><div class="modern" data-v-4efd4186></div><div class="old" data-v-4efd4186></div></div><div class="title" data-v-4efd4186>Origin/History</div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> Generally speaking, scholars agree that the origin of Bu Bu Dai Opera is Quanzhou, Fujian Province, around the 17th century. Since then, it has been difficult to distinguish between the different genres of Bu Bu Dai Opera because of the fact that the development area straddles Fujian and Taiwan, as well as the different periods of development and exchanges and fusions between the two genres. In terms of performance styles, the most general classification is between traditional and modern Bu Bu Dai Opera. Under this classification, even in Taiwan, where Bu Bu Dai Opera is still very popular, the audience for traditional Bu Dai Opera is much lower than that for modern Bu Dai Opera. What is commonly referred to as the Bu Bu Dai Opera genre is often actually the genre of traditional Bu Dai Opera. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> Similar art with the bag opera, in the north and south of China called different, in Beijing called &quot;Gou Li Zi&quot;, in the Northeast called &quot;Bian Tan Theatre&quot;, in Sichuan called &quot;wooden brain shell theatre&quot;, in Xi&#39;an, Lanzhou is called &quot;Juggling Rods&quot;, in eastern Fujian is called &quot;Mantle Theatre&quot;, in Ningbo is called &quot;Glove Puppet&quot;, in southern Fujian and Cangnan, Chongming Island, Southeast Asia and other areas of the southern Fujian dialect are called &quot;布袋戲&quot;. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> The origin of Bu Bu Dai Opera can not be clearly proved. Jin Dynasty Wang Jia &quot;Gleanings&quot; records: &quot;South of the South, there are Fu Lou country, its people are good at changing ...... or in the palm of the preparation of the music of the beasts, twisting and bending between the fingers. The human figure or long minutes, or several inches, the gods and monsters swiftly, Xuanli at the time.&quot; Female scholars Ding Yanzhao in the famous Dunhuang Mogao Caves Cave 31 found a painting in the Sheng Tang dynasty mural &quot;to get children,&quot; painted a woman raised her arms, using the fingers and palms of the children to give a performance of the situation. Wang Jia about the skills of the finger palm of the account and the Tang mural depicts the situation, and today&#39;s bag opera has similarities, if the same form, then, bag opera or can say the emergence of bag puppets should be in the Tang or Jin before, but did not find a more explicit record, or difficult as a conclusive proof of the origin of the bag opera in the Tang Dynasty. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> The origin of Cangnan&#39;s single-file Bubu Opera is said to have come from the north and the south, but from the aspect of its title, the style of performance which mainly focuses on literature, the use of the Southern Min dialect to say white, and the performances in the Southern Min dialect area, it should be originated from the southern school of Southern Min Bubu Opera, namely the Anxi school, which is rumoured to be introduced with the Fujian immigrants in the middle and the late Qing Dynasty, and according to the introduction of the entertainer Li Bulian, the person from Wufeng Township of Cangnan, Luhong, is the earliest of the main school of Cangnan&#39;s single-file Bubu Opera, the Wufeng school, who learnt the art from Quanzhou, Fujian. According to Li Bulian, Lu Hong, a native of Wufeng Township, Cangnan, was the earliest artist of the Wufeng School, one of the major schools of Cangnan&#39;s single-file 布袋 theatre, who learnt his art from Quanzhou, Fujian. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> However, due to the long history, people and things are not the same, Bu Bu Dai Opera in Southern Fujian has evolved into a multi-file form, Southern Fujian can not be found in the old single-file Bu Dai Opera, the single-file Bu Dai Opera in Cangnan can be preserved in the source can only be traced back to the Qing Daoguang period. After the census, from the Daoguang period to the present, in Cangnan can still identify more than 50 famous Bu Bu Dai Opera artists. These artists are mainly divided into two schools, the Lingxi School and the Wufeng School, each of which has its own performance characteristics. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> In the Qing Dynasty, Li Dou&#39;s &quot;Records of Yangzhou Painted Boat&quot; recorded that &quot;...... transported three-inch puppets with five fingers, the golden drums were noisy and angry, and the words were called Pelvette, and all of them were one person, which was called shoulder-carrying theatre.&quot; The &quot;shoulder-loaded theatre&quot; recorded in &quot;Yangzhou Painted Boat Record&quot; is relatively the same as the puppet theatre in the form of performance. Qing Jiaqing years the publication of the &quot;Jinjiang County Records&quot; Volume 72, &quot;Customs - Songs&quot;: &quot;There are Xi Dongjiao, Pipa, and the section to beat the person, cover the sound of heaven and earth, the former people do not think that the music manipulation of the soil sound, but that the Imperial Qing guest, the common people of today&#39;s stringed tune is also passed on. Another example is the seven children class, commonly known as the earth class, wooden theatre commonly known as puppets. Nearly again, there is a palm in the trick, commonly known as the bag theatre. Singing a song, each into a syllable.&quot; This is the earliest record of the title &quot;布袋戏&quot;. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> The history of Bu Bu Dai Opera is quite old, as recorded in the ancient Chinese books &quot;Old Story of Wulin&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Meng Hua Lu&quot;, palm puppetry was included in the gift list of the court banquet of the Song Dynasty. However, in the case of the traditional Bubu Opera, which is familiar today, the origins of the genre, in general, come from a legend in Quanzhou. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> Legend has it that during the Ming Dynasty in China, an old man, Liang Binglin, who had failed all his exams, had a dream after praying for high school at a temple at Jiu Li Lake in Xianyou County, Fujian Province, in which an old man wrote on his hand, &quot;Fame goes to the palm of your hand,&quot; and then left. Liang Xiucai woke up very happy, think it is a good omen and the first, but unexpectedly when the test and failed. Lost, he began to learn from his neighbours hanging silk puppetry, and developed a direct set in the hands of the dolls, with his literary training, the words, and can quote a variety of barnyard history, immediately attracted many people to see his performances, the bag opera from the local began to popular, Liang Xiucai&#39;s reputation has followed the rise of the boat, and at this time, he understood the meaning of the phrase &quot;fame returns to the palm of your hand! It was only then that he realised the meaning of the saying &quot;Fame returns to the palm of your hand&quot;. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> In addition, there is another theory about the origin of Bu Bu Dai Opera, that it was created by Sun Qiaoren, a failed scholar from Longxi County, Fujian Province, during the reign of Emperor Mu Zong Longqing (1567-1572) of the Ming Dynasty. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> Extension of Bu Bu Bu Opera: In the middle of the 17th century, Bu Bu Bu Opera had become quite popular in Southern Fujian, and a model similar to the Shoulder-Tan Opera had appeared. The so-called Shoulder-Tan Theatre is a theatre where the performer carries the theatre box and the stage on his shoulder. After arriving at a certain place and setting up a simple stage, the performer hides under a cloth curtain and shoulders the simple wooden stage, which becomes the stage for the puppet performance. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> In the 18th century, depending on the place of performance, not only professional groups appeared, but also depending on the place of performance, it was divided into outdoor performance of wild stage and theatre performance of inner stage. The Nodai Opera was performed by theatre troupes that were invited to perform in various places, and later it was gradually transformed into a performance for the purpose of welcoming and thanking the gods and wishing for longevity, with simpler sets and fewer performers. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> Although the Neitai theatre style appeared in the 18th century, it really flourished after the 20th century. Naitai theatre has more ornate sets, more puppets and more musical performers than Naitai theatre. However, due to the impact of new forms of entertainment such as film and television, after the 1980s, with the exception of a few exceptions, Nei Tai Opera has become quite rare in Southern Fujian and Taiwan. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> On the other hand, after the 1960s, the Nei Tai Theatre also developed a branch of the TV play. This type of theatre, where the stage is set up in a TV studio and the performance is held in the studio, not only flourished in Taiwan after the war, but also created a sensation. The medium and venues of performance even extended to cable television, video tapes, films, compact discs and multimedia after the 1990s. </div><div class="title" data-v-4efd4186>Artistic features</div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> Bu Bu Dai Opera is characterised by the direct manipulation of the actors with their fingers, resulting in fast-paced, swift and powerful movements. Longxi Budai Opera is known for its martial arts performances. The head of the puppet is the main part of its structure, and the sculptors Xu Niansong and Xu Zhuchu, father and son, made outstanding contributions. They carefully researched the faces of the various trades and roles in the theatre, and combined their own experience with their artistic skills to carve and paint many puppet heads that profoundly reflect the typical character of good, evil, loyalty and treachery, in a variety of ways. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> Fingers and palms are the key to the art of performance. Actors use the different postures of the dolls, head posture, hand posture, and step posture to shape the image of the dolls with inner activities, which is generalised, exaggerated and real, and the manipulation skills of &quot;reverse set&quot; (to show that the dolls &quot;carry their hands&quot;) and &quot;flying set&quot; (the dolls fly out of the air or leap into the air or leap over the wall, and then into the other hand) are even more astonishing. The actor has three &quot;selves&quot; - the actor, the role, and the puppet, and often plays two or more roles with both hands at the same time, multi-tasking and echoing freely, which is a clear indication of the difficulty and the actor&#39;s skill. </div><div class="title" data-v-4efd4186>Item on a program</div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> At the beginning of its popularity in the middle of the 17th century, the traditional form of Bu Bu Dai Opera was quite simple, with improvisation being the main form of performance, and it is still prevalent in some parts of Fujian, for example, in Taiwan you can still see occasional performances of Pendulum Immortals jumping to the Eight Immortals and other performances that do not have a spoken word to welcome the gods. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> In the 18th century, the Bu Bu Dai Opera began to pay more attention to its performances, and there appeared plays with a performance time of more than one hour, such as &quot;The Four Golden Skirts&quot;, &quot;The Tale of the Robe&quot;, &quot;The Pleasant Sparrow Sues&quot;, and so on, which are still in circulation today. However, the popularity of the literary theatre, which is based on the &quot;Talent and Beauty&quot; and the &quot;Trial&quot;, is not as good as the martial arts theatre in the traditional Bu Bu Dai Opera </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> So far, the traditional Bu Bu Dai Opera is still dominated by martial arts and historical novels, with the one-hour performances of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West, and Feng Shen Bang (The Goddess of the Seals) being the most popular rewritten chapter-and-chapter novels. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> In general, except for the music, almost all of the plays performed by Bubao Opera are based on spoken dialogues, and there is no singing, which is quite different from other traditional Chinese dramas. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> In addition to the above, after the 1980s, in Taiwan, where the development of Bu Bu Dai Opera is unique, martial arts, funny science fiction and other plays have been developed. The performance time is still about one hour, and the plays no longer follow the ancient system, but they are not usually classified as traditional Bu Bujiao, and in fact, some Taiwanese audiences do not even consider their performances as Bujiao. </div><div class="title" data-v-4efd4186>Classification of roles</div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> Guan Gong belongs to the flower face in Bu Bu Dai Opera, although the classification of Bu Dai Opera roles is derived from the Chinese theatre&#39;s Sheng, Dan, Pure, End, and Clown, but due to the design of the traditional play, there are no two types of roles: the end role and the clown role, so Bu Dai Opera roles are divided into six major categories, namely the &quot;Sheng&quot;, the &quot;Flower Face&quot;, &quot;Dan&quot;, &quot;Shinto&quot;, &quot;Monster&quot; and &quot;Miscellaneous&quot;. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> Sheng (生): refers to characters with a masculine style, of which Xiaosheng (小生) is usually the so-called protagonist nowadays, Wensheng (文生) is the intelligent male character, and Wusheng (武生) is the male character with an action-oriented style. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> Flower Face: mainly refers to the heroic, courageous male characters with very strong masculinity and virility. Such as red flower, green flower boy, black flower and so on, in addition to its special protagonist category of Guan Gong and Xu Liang puppets and so on; </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> Dan role: refers to the female characters with feminine temperament. Such as flower face Dan, Guanyin Dan, old Dan, small Dan and so on. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> Shinto: such as the God of Wealth, the three immortals, in addition to its special protagonist category of the Dragon King of the East China Sea, Wen Taishi and other gods and Taoist priests and so on. </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186>Monster: such as ox head and horse face.</div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> Miscellaneous roles: refers to the characters who run the show. Such as the old monk, the little shaman, and the lack of mouth; </div><div class="text" data-v-4efd4186> Until the 20th century, the new generation of Bu Bu Dai Opera, in fact, there are still traces of traditional categorisation in the spoken word. Take the roles of Taiwan&#39;s puppet theatre as an example, Shiyanwen and Su Huanzhen are literati, the Chaotic Mad Knife is a martial artist, Hengqianqiu and Exorcist are flower faces, Ji Xiaotang is more special and is a martial artist, which is a newly created type of role, and there are also clowns, such as Qin Fake Fairy and Ertiao, which are beyond the traditional roles. </div>',37),x={class:"intro1"},T={class:"tradit1"},D=a(()=>e("div",{class:"name1"},"Traditional Puppetry Theatre",-1)),S={class:"modern1"},O=a(()=>e("div",{class:"name1"},"Modern Puppet Theatre",-1)),_={__name:"index",setup(t){const{push:h}=u(),i=()=>{h("/traditional-games")};return(k,C)=>{const n=p("el-button");return m(),c("div",y,[w,b,e("div",q,[B,e("div",x,[e("div",T,[D,o(n,{style:{width:"100px"},type:"danger",class:"btn",onClick:i},{default:r(()=>[s(" Into ")]),_:1})]),e("div",S,[O,o(n,{style:{width:"100px"},type:"danger",class:"btn",onClick:i},{default:r(()=>[s(" Into ")]),_:1})])])]),o(d)])}}},I=l(_,[["__scopeId","data-v-4efd4186"]]);export{I as default};
